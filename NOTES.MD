- Describe in your own words what is z-score and Min-Max scaling and why would we need to use such normalization methods? describe by example, if possible.
```
Z-score normalization is a strategy of normalizing data that avoids this outlier issue.

Min-max normalization is one of the most common ways to normalize data. For every feature, the minimum value of that 
feature gets transformed into a 0, the maximum value gets transformed into a 1, and every other value gets transformed into a decimal between 0 and 1.
Min-max normalization has one fairly significant downside: it does not handle outliers very well.

- We used Junit5 in our test cases, describe in your own words why would we use such library? 
what is unit testing and why would we use it?
```
to test the results of methods that we created and ensure that give us the true result.
```
- What is the IDE did you use?
```
intellij
```

- Name the Java APIs you used?

- Mention down any difficulties or concerns you faced while working on the task. Your feedback is appreciated :D.
```
1- understanding how unit test works
2- uderstanding zscore and min-max normalization
3- imagine how to implement the assignment
3- rounding big decimal number to 2 digits and to nearest integer value
4- understanding and solving the error 'java.lang.ArithmeticException: Non-terminating decimal expansion; no exact representable decimal result' when dividing the big decimal number
```

- If you implement any of the bonus points, please mentioned it in this file
```

- Did this task enrich technical skills or knowledge? If yes, tell us how: 
```
yes,
i have learned about new two math classes (bg decimal and big integer),
also i have learned about new two topics (zscore and min-max) that are used in machine lrearing and big data 
```
